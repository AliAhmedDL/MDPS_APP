## Introduction

This multiple disease prediction system incorporates three built-in models to calculate the probability of an individual having a specific disease. 
It compares three distinct logistic regression models to determine the most effective model for each disease prediction.

## Illustraion

We trained three distinct machine learning models for each prediction task and assessed their performance by comparing them using the F1 score metric. 
The models utilized were Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and XGBoost Classifier.
The models were saved and loaded using pickle library.


## Features

- Machine learning model for Diabetes
- Machine learning model for Heart Disease
- Machine learning model for Parkinson's Disease

## Installation

You can install Stremlit library using this line of code.
```bash
pip install streamlit

You should have agithub accout to signup on streamlit platform.
